# Graph-based anomaly detection in the Python Package Index (PyPI)

## Overview
Model the PyPI dependency network as a graph. Use self-supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node embeddings and detect suspicious packages with unusual dependency patterns.

## Tools
- Graph Construction: NetworkX/PyG
- GNNs: GraphSAGE/DGI/GCN
- Anomaly Detection: Outlier scores from embeddings or structure
- Visualization: PCA/t-SNE, Streamlit
